                Hey, this is a blog entry!<br>
                I kinda feel like making a blog sometimes. Now is one of these times.<br>
                Sadly there's nothing here. For now.<br>
                <br>
                Also this has been hardcoded in HTML5 by hand. Maybe I'll want to use a blog generator some day. Eh.
